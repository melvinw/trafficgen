# Advanced Guide

The command to start traffic takes the follwing form

```
start PORT MODE [OPTIONS...]
```

## Modes

You can generate three types of traffic
+ `udp`: Simple stream(s) of UDP packets
+ `flowgen`: More realistic, flow-based traffic
+ `http`: Like `flowgen` but with HTTP payloads
+ `gtpu`: Like `udp` but with GPRS Tunneling packets

## Quick Start

Here are a few useful commands to quickly get started. See [Options](#options)
below for more a more detailed configurations.

A simple benchmarking scenario might involve measuring how well a DUT copes with
various amounts of incoming flows. You can generate 10,000 infinitely long-lived
UDP flows containing 60 byte packets with the following command. You can
identify which port to generate traffic on by either its PCI address in
`BUS:SLOT.FUNCTION` format, or by its integral DPDK port id.

```
localhost:10514 $ start 03:00.0 udp num_flows=10000, pkt_size=60
```

You can then check how well the DUT is keeping up by running `monitor port`
which will produce the output below. The `INC` columns indicate the rate of
return traffic from the DUT along with the average, median and 99th percentile
round-trip times experienced by packets (reported in microseconds).

```
localhost:10514 $ monitor port
Monitoring ports: 03:00.0 (Send CTRL + c to stop)

14:40:49.469716       INC     Mbps      Mpps   dropped   avg_rtt (us)   med_rtt (us)    99_rtt (us)         OUT     Mbps      Mpps   dropped
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
03:00.0/PMDPort            10128.9    15.070      3582         15.314         14.650         18.200               10134.5    15.081       143
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
```

Running `show config` will dump the current configuration of all active ports,
including information like MAC addresses, a list of cores used, and other
mode-specific settings:

```
localhost:10514 $ show config
Port 03:00.0
-----------
loss_rate:           disabled
pps:             <= line rate
mbps:            <= line rate
src_mac:    3c:fd:fe:a2:a6:e0
dst_mac:    02:1e:67:9f:4d:bb
src_ip:           192.168.0.1
dst_ip:              10.0.0.1
cores:                      0
pkt_size:                  60
num_flows:               1000
imix:                disabled
-----------
```

To step generating traffic just enter `stop 03:00.0` at the prompt.

If you're benchmarking a DUT over a fast NIC, you may need to use multiple cores
to saturate the link. You can do that by appending the `cores` option to your
command like so:

```
localhost:10514 $ start 03:00.0 udp num_flows=10000, pkt_size=60, cores="0 1"
```

Run `monitor ports` again and note the higher rates in the `OUT` columns.

```
localhost:10514 $ monitor port
Monitoring ports: 03:00.0 (Send CTRL + c to stop)

14:40:49.469716       INC     Mbps      Mpps   dropped   avg_rtt (us)   med_rtt (us)    99_rtt (us)         OUT     Mbps      Mpps   dropped

```

## Options 

There are several knobs you can tweak to control traffic. They are specified
like `foo="bar", baz=3`.

### General Options

The following options are applicable to all modes of traffic.

Option | Description
------ | -----------
`loss_rate` | Setting `loss_rate=X` will result in trafficgen sending traffic at rate such that it sees a frame last rate of `X` (in `[0,1]`) as defined by [RFC2544](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2544#section-26.3). If `loss_rate` is set, `pps` must be set to the initial sending rate. By befault `loss_rate` is not set and trafficgen sends at whatever rate you tell it to.
`pps` | Setting `pps=X` will result in trafficgen sending traffic at `X` packets per second. When set with `loss_rate`, trafficgen will start sending at `X` packets per second before adjusting the sending rate. By default `pps` is not set, meaning trafficgen will try to send at line rate.
`mbps` | Setting `mbps=X` will result in trafficgen sending traffic at `X` megabits per second. By default `mbps` is not set and trafficgen will try to send at line rate.
`cores` | Setting `cores` will split the work of generating traffic on a port across multiple cores. For example, setting `cores="0 1 2"` will result in trafficgen splitting traffic across cores `0`, `1` and `2`. By default `cores` is not set and trafficgen will pick an available core at random.
`src_mac`, `dst_mac` | Setting `src_mac=X` and `dst_mac=Y` will result in trafficgen setting the source and destination Ethernet addresses to `X` and `Y` respectively. By default `src_mac` is set to the Ethernet address of the sending port and `dst_port` is set to `02:1e:67:9f:4d:bb`.
`src_ip`, `dst_ip` | Setting `src_ip=X` and `dst_ip=Y` will result in trafficgen generating flows with source and destination IP addresses starting at `X` and `Y` respectively. By default `src_ip` and `dst_ip` are `192.168.0.1` and `10.0.0.1` respectively.

### UDP Options

The following options are only applicable to ports sending in `udp` mode.

Option | Description
------ | -----------
`num_flows` | Setting `num_flows=N` will result in trafficgen sending `N` flows. By default `num_flows` is set to `10`.
`pkt_size` | Setting `pkt_size=X` will result in trafficgen sending `X`-byte packets. By default `pkt_size` is set to `60`.
`imix` | Setting `imix=1` will result in trafficgen generate [Internet Mix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Mix)-like traffic. By default `imix` is not set and trafficgen generates fixed-size packets of `pkt_size` bytes.

### FlowGen Options

The following options are only applicable to ports sending in `flowgen` mode.

Option | Description
------ | -----------
`pkt_size` | Setting `pkt_size=X` will result in trafficgen sending `X`-byte packets. By default `pkt_size` is set to `60`.
`num_flows` | Setting `num_flows=N` will result in trafficgen sending `N` flows. By default `num_flows` is set to `10`.
`flow_duration` | Setting `flow_duration=X` will result in trafficgen generating flows that live for up to `X` seconds. By default `flow_duration` is set to `5` seconds.
`flow_rate` | Setting `flow_rate=R` will result in trafficgen generating `R` new flows per second. By default `flow_rate` is set to `num_flows` / `flow_duration`.
`arrival` | Setting `arrival` will change the distribution from which trafficgen generates flow IDs (5-tuples). It can be either `pareto` or `uniform`. By default `arrival` is set to `uniform`.
|`duration` | Setting `duration` will change the distribution from which trafficgen chooses flow lifetimes. It can be either `pareto` or `uniform`. By default `duration` is set to `uniform`.|

### HTTP Options

The following options are only applicable to ports sending in `http` mode.

Option | Description
------ | -----------
`num_flows` | Setting `num_flows=N` will result in trafficgen sending `N` flows. By default `num_flows` is set to `4000`.
`src_port` | Setting `src_port=X` will result in trafficgen generating HTTP traffic with TCP source ports starting with `X`. By default `src_port` is set to `1001`.

### GTP-U Options

The following options are only applicable to ports sending in `gtpu` mode.

Option | Description
------ | -----------
`num_enb` | Setting `num_enb=N` will result in trafficgen sending GTP-U packets from `N` diffreent eNodeBs, i.e. it will generate packets from `N` source IP addresses in the outer IP header. By default `num_enb` is set to `1`.
`flows_per_teid` | Setting `flows_per_teid=N` will result in trafficgen sending IP packets to `N` diffreent hosts, i.e. it will generate packets with `N` destination IP addresses in the inner IP header. By default `num_enb` is set to `5`.
`num_teids` | Setting `num_teids=N` will result in trafficgen sending packets from `N` different GTP-U tunnel endpoint identifiers(teids). By default `num_teids` is set to `1`.
`payload_size` | Setting `payload_size=N` will result in trafficgen sending GTP-U packets with `N`-byte payloads.
`dut_decap` | Setting `dut_decap` indicates that the DUT will decapsulate any received GTP-U packets and send back the inner IP packet. This is important for getting sensible latency measurements.
